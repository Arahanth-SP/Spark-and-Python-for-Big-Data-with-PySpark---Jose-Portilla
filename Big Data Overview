Big Data Overview:

•	What is “Big Data”?
•	Explanation of Hadoop, MapReduce and Spark
•	Local versus Distributed Systems
•	Overview of Hadoop Ecosystem
•	Overview of Spark

Big Data:
•	Data that can fit on a local computer, in the scale of 0-32 GB depending on RAM.
•	But what can we do if we have a larger set of data?
o	Try using a SQL database to move storage onto hard drive instead of RAM
o	Or use a distributed system, that distributes the data into multiple machines/computer.

Local versus Distributed System:
•	A local process will use the computation resources of a single machine
•	A distributed process has a access to the computational resources across a number of machines connected through a network
